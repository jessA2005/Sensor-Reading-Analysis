#THIS PROJECT INCLUDES:
Data preparation
Computing average temperature, stress, and displacement per sensor.
Identifying the sensor with the highest average stress.
Filtering and extracting all sensor readings where the temperature exceeds 36.0Â°C.
visualizations (e.g., line plots of stress over time) using MatplotLib
